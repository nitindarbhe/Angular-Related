Webpack is a bundler for modules. The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser

At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, 
it internally builds a dependency graph from  one or more entry points and then combines every module your project 
needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.

You can optionally use a config file to bundle your project. It has the following core concepts:
- Entry - specifies entry point for bundling the dependency graph
- Output - where to emit the bundle 
- Loaders - allows webpack to  process other types of files i.e. other than javascript, json
- plugins - bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.
- Mode - By setting the mode parameter to either development, production or none - one can enable webpack's built-in optimization
- Browser Compatibility - Webpack supports all browsers that are ES5-compliant (IE8 and below are not supported).
