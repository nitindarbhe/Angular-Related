What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript
that can run in any browser (even the old ones).

It makes available all the syntactical sugar that was added to JavaScript with the new ES6 specification, including classes, fat arrows and multiline strings.

We can also optionally use it to transpile TypeScript into regular JavaScript that will run in a browser.
